description: 'This 1899 collection of short stories includes the title story as well
  as four others: On the Fever Ship, The Man with One Talent, The Vagrant, and The
  Last Ride Together. These exciting tales of adventure are chilling, whether set
  on a Cuban battlefield or in the smoke-filled back rooms of Washington, D.C.'
